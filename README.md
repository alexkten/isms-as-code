# isms-as-code

### Motivation
I created this project to "standardise" the use of standards such as ISO27001 & NIST into a code format using JSON. Using [NIST OLIR Focal Documents Templates](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/olir/focal-document-templates) format, I recreated the ISO27001 controls in the same format.

### Repo includes:
* ISO27001 Folder
    * 2013 Standard
        * Annex A Controls as JSON
        * Annex A with Mandatory Documents as JSON
        * Clauses with Mandatory Documents as JSON
        * Clauses with Mandatory Documents as JSON & Mapping to 2022 Standard
    * 2022 Standard
        * Annex A Controls as JSON & Mapping to 2013 (iso27001:2022-c-2013map)
        * Annex A Controls (iso27001:2022-c)  

* NIST Folder
    * NIST Cybersecurity Framework
        * [CS Framework JSON](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/olir/documents/FocalDoc-Framework_V1.1.json) as JSON (FocalDoc-Framework_V1.1)
        * [CS Framework XLS](https://www.nist.gov/document/2018-04-16frameworkv11core1xlsx) as XLS (2018-04-16_framework_v1.1_core1)
        * NIST CC Framework Matrix Spreadsheet as JSON (CC1.1-Matrix.json)

    * [Privacy Framework JSON](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/olir/documents/FocalDoc-Privacy_Framework_V1.0.json) as JSON
